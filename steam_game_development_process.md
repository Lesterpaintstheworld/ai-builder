     * Specify UI and control differences between modes
     * Plan for seamless transition between VR and flatscreen
   - Describe the AI-human coexistence narrative
     * Outline main story arcs and side quests
     * Plan for branching narratives based on player decisions
1.3. Develop a project timeline and budget
   - Create a detailed development roadmap
   - Allocate resources for VR-specific development
1.4. Research and plan blockchain integration for ethical decision-making
   - Investigate blockchain platforms suitable for game integration
   - Design a system to record and validate player decisions on the blockchain

   - Create a robust ethical decision-making system with consequences
     * Develop a branching narrative system tied to ethical choices
     * Implement long-term consequences that affect city development
   - Implement detailed city-building and management mechanics
     * Create intricate resource chains and interdependencies
     * Develop city policies and ordinances system
5.2. Develop VR-specific features
   - Implement advanced teleportation systems with arc visualization
   - Create intuitive hand presence and gesture-based interactions
   - Develop VR-specific UI elements (e.g., holographic menus)
5.3. Create flatscreen-specific features
   - Implement advanced camera controls with multiple viewing modes
   - Develop keyboard shortcuts for efficient city management
   - Create context-sensitive mouse interactions
5.4. Implement save/load system
   - Develop a comprehensive game state serialization system
   - Create cloud save functionality for cross-platform play
5.5. Develop menu systems for both VR and flatscreen
   - Design intuitive VR menu interactions (e.g., virtual tablets, wrist menus)
   - Create equivalent menu systems for flatscreen with hotkeys
5.6. Integrate blockchain technology for ethical decision tracking
   - Implement secure blockchain transactions for major player decisions
   - Create a system to verify and display ethical choices across player base
5.7. Implement multiplayer features for collaborative city-building
   - Develop real-time synchronization of city states across clients
   - Create tools for player communication and cooperation
   - Implement systems for managing shared resources and responsibilities

## 6. Level Design
6.1. Create detailed levels based on the Cities of Lights concept
   - Design futuristic architecture and landscapes
   - Create distinct districts showcasing various AI specializations
6.2. Implement advanced lighting and post-processing effects
6.3. Place interactive elements and AI-driven NPCs
6.4. Design and implement ethical dilemma scenarios throughout the city
6.5. Create dynamic elements that change based on player decisions

## 7. Polish and Optimization
7.1. Refine gameplay mechanics
7.2. Optimize performance for both VR and flatscreen
7.3. Implement graphics settings for various hardware configurations

## 8. Testing
8.1. Conduct internal playtesting
